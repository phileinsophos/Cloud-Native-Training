# Cloud Native Training Lab Assignment

This lab assignment focuses on implementing changes to an application to integrate it with MySQL, creating a Helm chart to orchestrate deployment with a MySQL database, and automating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes using Jenkins.

## Objectives

1. **Application Integration with MySQL**
   - Modify the application to operate with a MySQL database.

2. **Helm Chart Creation**
   - Develop a Helm chart for the application that includes MySQL database integration.

3. **CI/CD Automation using Jenkins**
   - Implement Jenkins pipelines to achieve the following:
     - Pull code from GitHub repository.
     - Build the application code.
     - Create a Docker image.
     - Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
     - Deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster, either with or without Helm.

## Notes

- Customize configurations and scripts based on specific requirements.
- Ensure proper access controls and secrets handling in CI/CD pipelines.
- Test the entire workflow thoroughly to validate functionality and deployment.
- Document any encountered issues, improvements, or changes made during the process.
